**counters** | [**Dict[str, V1beta1Counter]**](V1beta1Counter.md) | Counters defines the counters that will be consumed by the device.  The maximum number counters in a device is 32. In addition, the maximum number of all counters in all devices is 1024 (for example, 64 devices with 16 counters each). | 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes_asyncio.client.models.v1beta1_device_counter_consumption import V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption from a JSON string
v1beta1_device_counter_consumption_instance = V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1beta1_device_counter_consumption_dict = v1beta1_device_counter_consumption_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption from a dict
v1beta1_device_counter_consumption_from_dict = V1beta1DeviceCounterConsumption.from_dict(v1beta1_device_counter_consumption_dict)
