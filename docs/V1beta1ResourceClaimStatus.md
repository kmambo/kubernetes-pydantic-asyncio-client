# V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus

ResourceClaimStatus tracks whether the resource has been allocated and what the result of that was.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**allocation** | [**V1beta1AllocationResult**](V1beta1AllocationResult.md) |  | [optional] 
**devices** | [**List[V1beta1AllocatedDeviceStatus]**](V1beta1AllocatedDeviceStatus.md) | Devices contains the status of each device allocated for this claim, as reported by the driver. This can include driver-specific information. Entries are owned by their respective drivers. | [optional] 
**reserved_for** | [**List[V1beta1ResourceClaimConsumerReference]**](V1beta1ResourceClaimConsumerReference.md) | ReservedFor indicates which entities are currently allowed to use the claim. A Pod which references a ResourceClaim which is not reserved for that Pod will not be started. A claim that is in use or might be in use because it has been reserved must not get deallocated.  In a cluster with multiple scheduler instances, two pods might get scheduled concurrently by different schedulers. When they reference the same ResourceClaim which already has reached its maximum number of consumers, only one pod can be scheduled.  Both schedulers try to add their pod to the claim.status.reservedFor field, but only the update that reaches the API server first gets stored. The other one fails with an error and the scheduler which issued it knows that it must put the pod back into the queue, waiting for the ResourceClaim to become usable again.  There can be at most 256 such reservations. This may get increased in the future, but not reduced. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from kubernetes_asyncio.client.models.v1beta1_resource_claim_status import V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus from a JSON string
v1beta1_resource_claim_status_instance = V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1beta1_resource_claim_status_dict = v1beta1_resource_claim_status_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus from a dict
v1beta1_resource_claim_status_from_dict = V1beta1ResourceClaimStatus.from_dict(v1beta1_resource_claim_status_dict)
