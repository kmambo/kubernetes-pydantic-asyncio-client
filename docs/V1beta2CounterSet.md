# V1beta2CounterSet

CounterSet defines a named set of counters that are available to be used by devices defined in the ResourceSlice.  The counters are not allocatable by themselves, but can be referenced by devices. When a device is allocated, the portion of counters it uses will no longer be available for use by other devices.

## Example

```python
from kubernetes_asyncio.client.models.v1beta2_counter_set import V1beta2CounterSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1beta2CounterSet from a JSON string
v1beta2_counter_set_instance = V1beta2CounterSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1beta2CounterSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1beta2_counter_set_dict = v1beta2_counter_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1beta2CounterSet from a dict
v1beta2_counter_set_from_dict = V1beta2CounterSet.from_dict(v1beta2_counter_set_dict)
